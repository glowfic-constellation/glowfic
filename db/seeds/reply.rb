    content: "Admiral Naismith's cabin on the <i>Triumph</i> has been stripped of most of his belongings.<br><br>Miles finds this out only <em>after</em> he gets out of the shower, so he's a little irritable by the time he confirms that even his space armour has vanished from its locker. Rather than test the oft-repeated assertion that he could carry on naked and make his officers feel overdressed, however, he gets back into his travel clothes.<br><br>On his way to the briefing room, he passes Sandy Hereld and nods a greeting. She gives him the startled glance of someone who was not expecting her admiral today. \"You're back, sir! That was quick.\"<br><br>Back from what, his two-hour visit to the hospital planetside? \"Eh?\"<br><br>They exchange looks of puzzlement as both continue in opposite directions, Miles toward a lift tube and Hereld toward a cross corridor. He puts the incident out of his mind as he swings into the tube and descends toward his meeting.<br><br>He arrives to find the day's third surprise: more than a dozen officers assembled on time, and Bel Thorne not among them. Bel late to a mission briefing is as likely as an eager child late to its own birthday party. Not to be thought of. Technically it won't be late for another ninety seconds or until Quinn shows up with the files, whichever comes later; still, weird not to see it perched in a chair waiting for presents in the form of a shiny new mission.<br><br>Miles frowns to himself, but shrugs and turns to ask of Elena, \"Did you get a chance to visit your mother?\"",

He trusts this subtext is conveyed by his expression. \"Naismith out.\"<br><br>Then he gets the message sealed and sent, and spends a little while longer poring over the mission files and muttering obscenities. Fucking Mark. This could be anything from misguided heroics to a bizarre and elaborate prank. The one thing he's sure it <em>isn't</em> is a trap. Mark has made it very clear what he thinks of being used as a weapon against Miles. If somebody were to try it against Mark's will, Miles's expectations lie firmly in the area of 'and the body was never found'.<br><br>So.<br><br>He calls up to Nav and Com again, and the comm officer on duty obligingly locates Baz, Elena, and Elli and directs them back to the briefing room.

If Dave Farber had broken your ribs and my father decided this was a crime he needed to prosecute, he could have gotten twenty people to tell him exactly who did it without any help from you at all.  So it wasn't a student.  Probably not a teacher either, especially since teachers beating up students isn't commonly a thing.  You didn't arrive at the hospital in an ambulance, but as a passenger in a car your family owns.  So you were not in the middle of nowhere when injured, and you were not unescorted - or you had access to a phone and you could get at it while you had your ribs broken, which is less likely.  It's possible the driver did it, but you've had the same one since that time, and I'd expect an incident like that to cause staff turnover, wouldn't you?  And you know what, I doubt your family makes a lot of family trips to places where you can get into fights.  And your driver wouldn't say where you came from even when a cop demanded the information.  Did someone ask the driver <em>reaaaally</em> nicely too?  But <em>I</em> think it happened at home.\"<br><br>She pauses, and tilts her head, stretching her arms, looking more severe.  \"You know what sort of beating-up relationship <em>is</em> commonly a thing?\"",
