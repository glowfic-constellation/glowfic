So it wasn't a student.  Probably not a teacher either, especially since teachers beating up students isn't commonly a thing.  You didn't arrive at the hospital in an ambulance, but as a passenger in a car your family owns.  So you were not in the middle of nowhere when injured, and you were not unescorted - or you had access to a phone and you could get at it while you had your ribs broken, which is less likely.  It's possible the driver did it, but you've had the same one since that time, and I'd expect an incident like that to cause staff turnover, wouldn't you?  And you know what, I doubt your family makes a lot of family trips to places where you can get into fights.  And your driver wouldn't say where you came from even when a cop demanded the information.  Did someone ask the driver <em>reaaaally</em> nicely too?
