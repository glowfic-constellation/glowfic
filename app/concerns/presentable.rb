# frozen_string_literal: true
# include Presentable in a model Model to have it automatically use app/presenters/ModelPresenter.rb to generate its JSON.
#
# Can safely be included on classes with no presenter file;
# it will fall back to the default / inherited as_json method.
#
# Limitations:
# - Presenter must have an initializer that takes the model as an argument
# - Presenter must implement as_json(options={})
# - If the class Model implements its own as_json method, that will override the presenter
#   but can access the presenter as_json through super (even if the presenter is included _afterwards_)
