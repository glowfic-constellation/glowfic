    Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

    We collect this to understand how our visitors use our service, and use it to make decisions about how to change and adapt the service.

  %p
    From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in aggregate form (for instance, by publishing trends in site usage) to explain our reasoning in making decisions.
    We will not release individual information, only aggregate information.

  %p
    We collect and process Logs of server interactions, as well as event logs.
    We need this information for legal and accounting/audit reasons, including maintaining the integrity of the Constellation and the Content that we host.

  %ul
    %li To diagnose and repair issues with your use of the site;
    %li To estimate the number of users accessing the service from specific geographic regions;
    %li To help prevent fraud and abuse.

  %p
    We collect information about certain pages users access or visit, as well as referral information (i.e. data about what site you are coming to the Constellation from) and whether there are errors in displaying Content to you.
    This information may be associated with your account (for instance, when we log that a user has read the first page of a post).
    We need this information
    to maintain the integrity of the site, the Service and the Content that we host;
    to provide you with the Content that you are seeking;
